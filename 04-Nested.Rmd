# Random and Mixed Effect Models {#ch:nested}

(In progress)

## Nested design

* Motivations for a nested design
* Nested design with fixed factors 
    - Sampling scheme
    - Hypothesis testing
    - Causal interpretation
* Nested design with random factors
* Nested design with mixed factors
    - Repeated measures design 


## Random effects model

* One-way ANOVA model with random effects
* Estimation
    - Decomposition of variances
* Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals 

### Mixed effects model 

### Unbalanced mixed and random effect models



## Learning Objectives

* Students are able to write down the two-way ANOVA model with random effects.
* Students can properly decide whether to model a factor using fixed or random effects. 
* Students recognize the key assumptions associated with the random effects model. 
* Students can implement the aforemened tasks in `R`.
* Students can explore extension of random effect model from the Internet.
